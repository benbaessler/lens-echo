## Report bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/benbaessler/lens-echo/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, and background

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
